            Prisoned in the grubby broken hovel of memories,<br>
            They were too old to be erased,<br>
            She was too scared to be touched by time.

        <hr>
        <p>
            Through the illusive shadows of existence<br>

I've tried to find something that's mine<br>

Eaten by a vision in my head<br>

You know what it means,<br>

to govern the shalow part of the light?<br>

Deserts shout out through their cracks<br>

Your desperate, regretful moan<br>

The sigh of the sun, warms my cold hands<br>

You're still so afraid, to be left alone!<br>

Suffocating neighs,<br>

Regrets of your life<br>

How could I breathe<br>

through my disguise?<br>

I try to let go,<br>

As I forgo<br>

I'll try to forget,<br>

For I need to bare,<br>

Another sorrow...<br>

For I know some day<br>

A colder smile,<br>

may touch my heart<br>

For I know I'll free,<br>

a colder sigh<br>

For I know what I own,<br>

is my little heart
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Then the little drops of<br>

Anguish will run<br>

Together,<br>

The smoke that roams,<br>

Looking for a home,<br>

Will drift<br>

Into me,<br>

Choking my lost soul.<br>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Craving of devotions<br>

Rain of the stars<br>

You mend inside me<br>

Along my scars<br>

Warmth of your palms<br>

Pour in my vessel<br>

I’m plonked on your face<br>

Like a small freckle
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I want to be somewhere else<br>

Somewhere far away<br>

Where the rivers shine<br>

And the truth isn't bail<br>

The silver linings wink at my face<br>

The Gloomy outwear of what I smell<br>

Is about to fade, and I want to be<br>

Somewhere far away...<br>

The old big sun will blame us if we stay<br>

Lingering along the same hateful errors,<br>

Dreaming to win the same old fight,<br>

Is no more worth another quarrel,<br>

And I will be away, I will be awake.<br>

Where I call my mother and there's no answer,<br>

Where I know I'll be lost in the roads.<br>

The bitter exile keeps calling my name<br>

And I will be, so far away<br>

Nonetheless, this darkness makes sense<br>

Nonetheless, the grief is not the same<br>

Ready for a different view, different solitude,<br>

Even though my heart won't bear the ache<br>

See the silence and accept the trade,<br>

Bear the poison to have the sweet nectar flow in you vein<br>

Hear the vibes and pack with shaking hands,<br>

Cause I might embrace the strange warmth I'm looking for,<br>

In other lands…<br>

Shine in golden power and fly with rotten wings<br>

There might be no home tender, but the world may take a glimpse<br>

Of you being brave, of you being alive,<br>

Cause this nasty vehicle is no more worth a drive.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            May I dream and still be in peace?<br>

May I love and avoid the crisis…?
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            As I’d give every ounce of joy I didn’t have<br>

And I’d gamble every chance I didn’t get<br>

I would let go of all my unsaved memories<br>

I would unknow the people I never met<br>

If I tell you how we never drifted<br>

Will the fog around your head be lifted<br>

Will you unfeel the loss that bared my soul<br>

Will you rewrite the sadness of my dole<br>

To see once more, to feel my skin<br>

To just rebreathe, be washed in sin<br>

To cry my grief and then unwind<br>

To wear your scent and read your mind
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I hope when you split the pain in two,<br>

            And my sky turns gray and blue<br>
            
            Half the burden falls from you<br>
            
            Down on me behind the sea,<br>
            
            My eyes shine with gloom and glee<br>
            
            You spot the dire cure and key<br>
            
            I hope you flow on my aching soul,<br>
            
            At the end of this endless dole,<br>
            
            And my heart feels pure and whole<br>
            
            Dwell upon this disquietude,<br>
            
            And we’ll dance the frozen solitude,<br>
            
            For this misery is cruel and crude.<br>
            
            And if you finally saw me through,<br>
            
            And if you felt it clean and true,<br>
            
            I hope the burden falls from you.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            After the eyelids fall down<br>

In the heart of wonderland<br>

You get to a drowning hole<br>

Where reality gets disband<br>

Will I find myself, before the final doom?<br>

Will the dead flowers finally bloom?<br>

Drunk up on pain, drowning in sight<br>

You'll defeat your love, in a dark moonlight.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Once the sun tears its chest, there’s nowhere to bail<br>

Colors beating on the mountains<br>

Colors beating on the clouds<br>

Bodies getting sucked into the depth of the dale<br>

But the leaves of the trees<br>

Know your sadness, know your grief<br>

But the leaves of the trees<br>

Give you stance, give you belief<br>

Organized movements of black creatures wandering<br>

They have all the jungle to spread their anger in<br>

Shivers down the dancing skulls in the sky<br>

All is lost like the figures when they start pondering<br>

But the leaves of the trees<br>

Soaking in the autumn breeze<br>

But the leaves of the trees<br>

Carrying around the sounds of bees<br>

Oh cry inside your skull to swim your way out of this dump<br>

Oh cry for the rootless dolls who are lost inside this slump<br>

But the leaves of the trees<br>

Falling down<br>

Flump, flump<br>

Talk to them back to back with no word<br>

They show you how everything is absurd
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            O little girl! Who is shouting your name?<br>

Through all the rocken eons of blame<br>

O little hands, little eyes, little minds!<br>

Who never see the flaming of hearts…<br>

She danced to the dancing hands of pain<br>

She went through the roads out of her brain<br>

Don't tell her she's lost, no don't talk any claim<br>

She saved us all from self-torturing to gain<br>

Non-written letters of her side to us<br>

Red and red lines that she saw and crossed<br>

Seeking to lift the weight of every crime<br>

She held the burden of regret, of time<br>

O sun! You lived before she lived<br>

You've kept an eye on this eternal guilt<br>

O sun! How heavy is your glowing abandoned heart...<br>

She knows, she screams the silence, she's about to shine.<br>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I'm inside a bubble, I call it my solitude<br>

            Dancing with a shadow, let's call it your lassitude<br>
            
            Walking fearfully, on the edge of this cliff<br>
            
            Where are the dozen dreams, in which I had belief?<br>
            
            Turns out silence is precious<br>
            
            What we never say remains<br>
            
            Turns out the years of outage were luminous<br>
            
            All the candles we tried to light, were meaningless<br>
            
            Take me with you, call my name with silent lips<br>
            
            I'll feel the rhythm too loud, too deep<br>
            
            Take me with you, in the deepest darkness<br>
            
            I'll see what I need, I am not heartless<br>
            
            The music is heard, the beauty is seen<br>
            
            More than any time, more than what you mean<br>
            
            The blue uneven waters, have touched my feet<br>
            
            The breeze has peacefully blown, in the valley green<br>
            
            So make me stay, by saying almost nothing<br>
            
            Words will ruin the silence, they are fragile and so breaking<br>
            
            Let me touch your skin, under the moonlight<br>
            
            Cause all handmade lights, are actually lies.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            It's when u try and try,<br>

When you no more can cry,<br>

You’ll be on the edge of the cliff<br>

Where you wait for a fixed belief,<br>

That never comes by…<br>

Days pass so fast, exhausting you more<br>

Sun goes up and down<br>

Like a tired whore...,<br>

On the top of everything u dared doing<br>

A deafening silence will keep moaning.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Oh sun! The abandoned shine<br>

Oh sin! Your glory's gone<br>

Oh my immortal friends, my fears!<br>

World has gone on, before I make you run.<br>

Oh my poor mind, your tears are back<br>

Your rotten outwear, your obsessions have cracked<br>

Oh, its back what you washed yourself of.<br>

Once again, by the claws of a mad murderer of souls,<br>

dignity is racked...
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Baby there's no need to fear<br>

Baby there's no need to cry<br>

You fuse my broken bones<br>

Back together and then<br>

Lift the weight of the world<br>

From my shoulders again<br>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Walking alone, under the sky<br>

Loneliness is what love will bring<br>

Stupid how I crush, thinking of you<br>

The way I'm jealous, of everything<br>

I'm jealous of the wind<br>

Of that smooth breeze,<br>

That touches your hair,<br>

Like the autumn leaves<br>

I'm jealous of the ground,<br>

You put your step on<br>

The earth's lucky corps,<br>

That you move upon<br>

I'm jealous of the air,<br>

That you inhale,<br>

Nectar and sweet,<br>

Getting warm in your vein<br>

I'm jealous of that goddess,<br>

Who drew your face<br>

She must have kissed you,<br>

After a long gaze<br>

Oh I'm jealous of the rain drops,<br>

Appeared by your call<br>

Who touch your skin,<br>

In their pretentious fall<br>

I'm so jealous of me,<br>

And my heavy heart<br>

Your shadow is here, my feelings grow,<br>

No end to this warmth, no end to this warmth

        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I could read your eyes<br>

I could hear you bleed<br>

I could feel your pain<br>

When I lived your creed<br>

It snows in my heart<br>

For counting your lies<br>

Would fall to watch them<br>

Dressed with disguise<br>

Listen to my breaths<br>

Playing my heartbeat<br>

Spotting your smiles<br>

When euphonies meet<br>

There I dance alone<br>

Extolling delusions<br>

Mistakes change into<br>

Praised confusion<br>

My time collapses<br>

In uncertain places<br>

My sinful existence<br>

Is scarred embraces<br>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Little girl don't cut your hair<br>

Shout all the pain you can't bear<br>

Don't let your skin get colder than this<br>

Don't lose it over just a fear<br>

Look out the window through mornin<br>

As the tension is peacefully storming<br>

Free your hands of the rotten gloves<br>

Over nothing you're still mourning<br>

Remember it was cold like now,<br>

You said your "always" hasn't come yet<br>

You were promised an endless order,<br>

In which you'd face no harmful threat<br>

You mended me in broken wings<br>

And when you're gone I easily shatter<br>

Little girl so simply threatened,<br>

You cut your hair and it didn't matter<br>

Trusted the warmth beneath your rage<br>

You put your soul for what you believed in…<br>

If oceans were calm and love was pure,<br>

How come your wounds are bleeding?<br>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            To soothe my filthy conscious,<br>

I try to kill you every night<br>

Though I constantly dream of,<br>

Holding your shadow tight<br>

My sickest nightmare is,<br>

A halo above my head<br>

Though paradise gets far<br>

My innocence is dead<br>

All I hear is "white noise",<br>

What an awful sound!<br>

This falsetto is heard,<br>

Only if you get drowned<br>

Scars appear, all over my body<br>

Tension aggresses, to kill "somebody"<br>

Knowing someone is, watching all my twists<br>

Sickness has some world that I embody<br>

My smile fades, my laughs become ill<br>

Cigarettes won't work, drugs wouldn't heal<br>

Feeling someone is, watching my disguise<br>

Cry and laughter, mixes-up my creeds<br>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            If I tell you how the nights are going by<br>

            If I tell you how I'm trying to get by<br>
            
            How every night a headache lights a fire up<br>
            
            How we lift off at the point where we picked up<br>
            
            And that doubts and sorrows have enclosed me<br>
            
            How your words feed me to be free<br>
            
            We linger to be borne by the sunrise<br>
            
            As this desire burns inside my eyes<br>
            
            I wander unaware, roaming in despair<br>
            
            The pain I gulp down, the distance that I bear.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Twisted me my friend, my guide<br>

The ache you feel inside your chest<br>

When I'm failing my life, my goal, my test<br>

Your absence in my wide pupils<br>

We're two half, we're the completest<br>

Hello me walking on strings in my brain<br>

The same blood river's running in our vein<br>

Other people are a galaxy away<br>

You feel my obsessions, my fears, my pain
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The uneven waves of the most limpid waters<br>

The aftermath of every little sin<br>

The doleful beauty of getting more drowned in lust,<br>

My breaths are getting deeper than they've ever been.<br>

The wild sounds of pain in my ears,<br>

The perfumed air around your beautiful megrims<br>

The hallucinating tension of your corps,<br>

My constant nightmares turn into colorful dreams.<br>

If I share my overwhelming side,<br>

Will the fog around your gesture be lifted?<br>

If I swear to the mother of nature,<br>

Will the blooming tree be finally gifted?,<br>

To me....<br>

Tell me what's the way that makes me the real "me",<br>

When you ride your bike to the supreme throne<br>

Tell me what’s the heaven like that you are within,<br>

When you fall asleep and the pure souls shrink,<br>

To where they belong...<br>

When the sea shore is in peace and the rain forests are in calm,<br>

While the shiny full moo<br>

When the furthest star that I know explodes and you feel the ruin,<br>

Show me what’s the rightest way to fly too high,<br>

Like you easily do it...
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            After the eyelids fall down<br>

In the heart of wonderland<br>

You get to a drowning hole<br>

Where reality gets disband.<br>

Shush little baby, don't be upset<br>

No matter how you shatter,<br>

Your heavy heart's the target<br>

Listen and enjoy the BANG, BANG!
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I try to forget your face,<br>

As I run through the woods<br>

The cold burns my skin, freezes my tears,<br>

Try to get over, wandering along these roads<br>

I try to get up, on my shaky legs<br>

Survive all the pain that will never mend<br>

All the poems melt, in my burning heart<br>

Nothing will remain, nothing will be held<br>

I try to find love, in my frozen soul<br>

Whilst I look at me, inside the mirror<br>

Illness and Madness, show themselves to me<br>

In my stomach, something moves lately<br>

I tried to pretend, like I was strong<br>

Fall in love with you again, when I get drunk<br>

I'm becoming mother, having your baby<br>

Feel my soul gets sick, around morning, lately<br>

I burst into laugh, I burst into tears<br>

Feel my existence burns, and disappears<br>

I was confused, I couldn't believe<br>

That I was gravid, by Satan's seed<br>

I smell like sin, I smell like you<br>

Nobody ever gets, what I'm going through<br>

I own a fire, burning me inside<br>

That is the point where, my innocence died...
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Tell me something nice!<br>

            As you shrink through who you are,<br>
            
            In the moonlit autumn nights<br>
            
            Tell me what it's like,<br>
            
            To be emotional and perpetually high - without doing drugs;<br>
            
            Tell me, tell me something nice!<br>
            
            Cause my world, constantly trembles.<br>
            
            And in the flames of the sun,<br>
            
            I saw the fight of demon with flying angels.<br>
            
            Cause I keep trying and down I fall,<br>
            
            And whenever in life, I resist pain,<br>
            
            I feel a bitter weakness in my tired ankles.<br>
            
            Why did I first dance with bare feet,<br>
            
            Why did I ever question my creed,<br>
            
            How did I fall for darkness and pain,<br>
            
            When did I realize that this loss was the biggest gain?
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            It landed in me, slowly and calm<br>

When I wished for good, looking at a star<br>

It stepped inside, in a magic night<br>

I don't even know, it was wrong or right<br>

I have drowned in life, I have flied to death<br>

I felt joy in pain, in my sickness depth<br>

There's a part in me, begging for the truth<br>

Nothing I could find, purer than the pain<br>

At a point in time, calm murdered my peace<br>

At a point in life, innocence was not sweet<br>

Fire in the lake, tortured little fish<br>

I don't even know, if it's what I wished<br>

I have drowned in life, I have flied to death<br>

I felt joy in pain, in my sickness depth<br>

There's a part in me, begging for the truth<br>

Nothing I could find, purer than the pain<br>

Slowly I felt, getting drowned in night<br>

Suffocating nightmares swallowed the light<br>

Tortured me inside, setting itself free,<br>

I can't even say if that thing was "me"<br>

I have drowned in life, I have flied to death<br>

I felt joy in pain, in my sickness depth<br>

There's a part in me, begging for the truth<br>

Nothing I could find, purer than the pain<br>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I needed some peace,<br>

Cause I was drowning in the overwhelming "you"<br>

I couldn't breathe,<br>

That’s how I feel when you feed me the pieces of "truth"
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The old smoky picture of memories in my heart,<br>

            The bad vibes of not getting what I want,<br>
            
            The dreams weren't true as much as nightmares.<br>
            
            And I'm falling again...<br>
            
            Falling again for you.<br>
            
            The big old sun out there shines every morning،<br>
            
            As my tension is peacefully storming,<br>
            
            All the songs I wrote about you fly,<br>
        
            They get far from me.<br>
            
            And I get to feel that you never need me again…<br>
            
            Never again need me.<br>
            
            When childhood walked away and didn't leave a trace,<br>
            
            Mommy alerted me not to make mistakes…<br>
            
            But darling come here, lay down by my side<br>
            
            Let me smile to your face,<br>
            
            So big and wide.<br>
            
            God wouldn't forgive the sins who smile again…<br>
            
            Yea it again smiled at me,<br>
            
            So big, so wide.<br>
            
            Oh baby they say Love's crazy<br>
            
            It's known for the pain and the misery<br>
            
            Oh baby they say it becomes treasure<br>
            
            Only if it breaks and one of us leaves,<br>
            
            All I feel burns in my heart, like our shadows in bed.<br>
            
            Tell me that's not what you believe,<br>
            
            Tell me that's a lie,<br>
            
            Cause this is melting my heart again…<br>
            
            It again melts the soul in my lovely crime.  
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I’m a dream! Wish me, make me come true…<br>

I felt your pulse, your veins, and your blood pressure;<br>

There's a limit to your care;<br>

There's a limit to their care.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I don't wanna be ignored, oh God<br>

            When I'm a gun in a fist fight<br>
            
            You're chewing with an open mouth, raw meat<br>
            
            Your blood drool attracts the flies<br>
            
            I don't wanna be left out or get fucked<br>
            
            But there's a talent in your lies<br>
            
            If you're chewing with an open mouth, my raw meat<br>
            
            Know that your blood drool attracts the flies!
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I stare at the stars in the new moon's gentle light<br>

When the rocken mountains, sleep and snore<br>

As the lonely lighthouse, looks at the sky,<br>

standing far away from the sea shore<br>

Pretty lonely lighthouse,<br>

Someone lives in you, dreadfully tired<br>

You are the home of a lonely monster<br>

So different from the nasty souls, people admire<br>

When the twilight arrives, the three of us can hear,<br>

The tough sound of the wild horse hooves.<br>

The big spinning wheel,<br>

Spins a long dream,<br>

Behind people's eyelid,<br>

And will make them stay asleep,<br>

'til the sunshine fully grows.<br>

Before every sunup, I walk in my sleep<br>

Put my bare feet into the strange, uneven water.<br>

Wishing for the waves to bring me what belongs to me<br>

The very sad drift of my hair-strands, one after another<br>

Should rush before the start of the sun's play;<br>

To find out a way,<br>

And share with the beautiful monster, only one nightmare.<br>

Something inside me, won't let me sleep<br>

Like the tree of life, it's always been there<br>

Scared and in love, in pain "inside"<br>

The beast's woken up, destined to scare<br>

Too late again, the clouds are melted<br>

And they are to gaze<br>

As the sun shines,<br>

And burns the waves.<br>

There goes the sea, right down the sky<br>

And nobody knew, how it went by...
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I would share "my very core" to be heard<br>

Deep beneath the surface, I see your smiles<br>

To find a way to seek your talented lie<br>

I try to draw on the water surface some lines<br>

In your own round, you know the truth<br>

Even the wrong words seem so right.<br>

I hurt and something grows in me<br>

I let go of all my childhood kites<br>

Disappears in front of my eyes<br>

Everything I could ever lean to<br>

A dark deep lake of illusion,<br>

is what I constantly dive into.<br>

Oh, my friend, my guide, my soul mate!<br>

We never agreed I'll reach what I want<br>

My sweetheart, I've fallen down several times,<br>

Within the path you want me to crawl<br>

The Beauty blinds my eyes<br>

The blindness hallucinates my creed<br>

I'll stay on this destination-less road<br>

Oh darling! That’s the thing we agreed
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I pretend I'm not that involved,<br>

I show my healthy face to your meanest side<br>

I embrace your shadow, you hide.<br>

Meanwhile all your touch-less gallantries, I die.<br>

For the first time in my life, I feel warm, in love,<br>

For the very first time I'm in serious danger, but who gives a fuck!<br>

Who knows about dark eyes, about silence and real charm,<br>

Who cares about broken ribs sunk into my heart..<br>

When it comes to the golden smoke you spread,<br>

I can easily forget about every goddamned pain<br>

When my red eyes start to whisper, to claim,<br>

Surrendered I have to kill, every nag or every blame.<br>

I open my wings, even though I'm weak<br>

I cry all my tears out, to get rid of this creep<br>

Then again I walk, on this trembling surface<br>

You smile and watch me, you're such a freak!
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Cause I guess you're from a perfect world<br>

A world that threw me away Yesterday, Tomorrow, and Today.<br>

But, all the drugs in the world,<br>

Won't save me from this sick obey.<br>

One day the Sun will swallow, the only Earth we have.<br>

The clouds will land, the stars may fall down,<br>

Though, I'll be coming back for you,<br>

Tomorrow, Yesterday, or even Now.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            What would be pretty,<br>

To be seen in this dark?<br>

What would be the point,<br>

If I can't touch your heart…<br>

No matter how you hurt me,<br>

My heart won't stop leaking till it dries<br>

I want you so bad that if I could fly,<br>

I would give you all the clear, blue skies<br>

Sunshine's warmth grows on my hair<br>

Rivers of life flow on my ajar eyelids<br>

The roots of my soul digs in your chest,<br>

To find the madness that relaxes it<br>

Black creatures in my head,<br>

The brightest souls in your heart,<br>

Look how everything matches,<br>

Look how logic can be wrong!
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            If I open my dusty chest,<br>

            Who knows what will be spread<br>
            
            A blood drawl who runs down, toward my legs<br>
            
            Or a vast plain full of cacti who are dreadfully dead<br>
            
            If I randomly choose a body to love,<br>
            
            What will souls mean to me inside?<br>
            
            Now that I'm this close to be myself,<br>
            
            Now that I'm finally feeling alive.<br>
            
            If my nasty side believes in daylight,<br>
            
            What can make it kill, this lovely insight<br>
            
            Now that I've found beauty in darkness,<br>
            
            How can I ever feel sorry for the blind<br>
            
            Lighthouses or apartments, graves or cottages,<br>
            
            Warmth can be found where peace belongs<br>
            
            When you're almost numb of exhaust and of grief,<br>
            
            It's where the smoky outfit of that dragon, slowly dies...
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            How feeble is man's power<br>

Cause when it comes to real falls,<br>

Cannot add another hour<br>

Not even a second recalls!<br>

How fragile is the man's patience<br>

That if dust covers hope,<br>

There doesn't seem to be in palms,<br>

Another fortune-reaching rope!
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I surrender to tears, to the lassitude of your side<br>

I drown and my fire burns through the night<br>

I watch my body, giving up my soul till it's all dried<br>

Tell me, what are the other symptoms of love?<br>

Lay down right here and love me<br>

Look at me in the eyes with that mesmerizing sight<br>

As I stare at the moon so lonely,<br>

Tell me what are the other symptoms of love?<br>

If I ever use wrong words to explain,<br>

Read the right ones in the way I try<br>

You defeat me in all dirty games that you play in mind<br>

Tell me, what are the other symptoms of love?<br>

Inclined toward the vicissitudes of time,<br>

I'll dance with the devil you raise inside<br>

My blood smells like lavender, sin and crime<br>

Tell me, tell me,<br>

What are the other symptoms of love?<br>

Burn me, annihilate the only life I've got<br>

But don't ever ask me to take Goodbyes...<br>

Ignore my dignity as you parade your beauty to my eyes,<br>

And tell me, what are the other symptoms of love?
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            A frozen daisy, a faded sigh…
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            To love is to suffer<br>

Not to love is to suffer<br>

This short eternity of life,<br>

Has little joy to offer.<br>

Smiling faces make me bored<br>

"No Tears" to me is absurd<br>

Pretending to be "Not Alone",<br>

But blood drawls show the hole!<br>

I'll care for love, for eyes and light kisses<br>

I swear that I'll embrace these blesses<br>

But most of me is still prisoned,<br>

In the claws of evil witches!<br>

I want, I want, I want Desir<br>

I reach my hand to catch the fire<br>

No more my corps feels the burn,<br>

In love with Suffer, I'll dance much higher!<br>

Do you miss me every time,<br>

the Golden sun fakes it's shine?<br>

Is it bad that I've enjoyed sin,<br>

since I was not more than nine...
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Nothing ordinary will no more make u wanna love<br>

Like a black butterfly who flies out of her cocoon<br>

U won't heal easily,<br>

You wounds will shatter you alone
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I can't sleep or get things done<br>

Though I could hear the blood-leak<br>

I can't remember my own name<br>

Yet I can say I still breathe<br>

Some hands search for my soul,<br>

But they reach my breasts, my waist<br>

Some hands search for my hair<br>

Black, short, smelling like fresh air<br>

In my body, I'm alone<br>

Nor dead, nor alive, I don't know...<br>

Some lips I see smiling,<br>

Some lips search for me, whole night through<br>

Try to survive all by me<br>

Panic penetrates through my skin<br>

I'm the thorn of this flower-towel<br>

This is my life I'm risking<br>

Swear to the black blood that runs out of my chest,<br>

Swear to the drug I feel in my veins,<br>

I've been dead for a long, long time<br>

Yet I could say that I'm fine!
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            All the good is drifted to become the bad one day<br>

And the darkness wins the light, we know!<br>

There's a side of us holding this twist,<br>

It's a seed we're raising to escape the fake glow<br>

And when you touch us, the sun kinda dies<br>

Surrounded by your shadow to be followed<br>

Aren't you afraid of the Lord's anger,<br>

As you keep seducing the stars that are softly hollowed<br>

Whilst turning your sight to find the moon in the sky,<br>

You invoke the spirit of the clouds, you make them cry<br>

You're familiar more than us, with the notion of Life<br>

Even though thousands of times, you've made us die<br>

Aren't you afraid that it kills us all someday,<br>

The demon that you feed inside..?<br>

I'm catching to love the pain and the misery,<br>

Still, we're all shedding the burden of this crime<br>

When the fire doesn't burn and the sun ain't enough<br>

There's a chance to enjoy the snow and the rain<br>

Keep us in fire, or make us freeze,<br>

We know that this loss, is the biggest gain.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I was told to forget it, so I said:<br>

“forgotten it is.", though it was a lie<br>

There's nothing out this little window,<br>

But the pretty starless sky...<br>

Remember that memories will be remembered<br>

Cause in your hands, my all is tempered<br>

Remember I've forgotten to live,<br>

To dream, to be able to, to know how to, to handle...<br>

Would it help if I burn the picture that<br>

Is still stuck in that old frame?<br>

Will my madness mend a bit,<br>

If I yell, if I scream, if I kill, if I blame..?<br>

I thought that was where it ends,<br>

But it starts every day<br>

I was told to let it go,<br>

My heart, my brain, my humble gain...
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            As I look in the mirror,<br>

I try to stare cold and smooth<br>

I make my heart beat slowly<br>

Because I don't want to lose you<br>

Deep in silence my nights end<br>

I see my veins turning blue<br>

Squeeze my eyes force myself to sleep<br>

Because I don't want to lose you<br>

I grab my head in my hands<br>

Although it won't mend my gloom<br>

Something's stuck in my throat, shush hide it!<br>

Because I don't want to lose you<br>

My heart burns and explodes into pieces<br>

I reach my hand to find yours<br>

Extinguish this fire! Yes I can do it,<br>

Because I don't want to lose you<br>

Look me in the eyes the way you began<br>

Even though it's hard, I'll let go of sorrow<br>

Remember the way I let you go each time,<br>

Just cause I don't want to lose you
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            If I tell how my days pass by<br>

If I say I cannot go along, that would be a lie<br>

To be strong sounds good when it's said<br>

But to do it, I'm bleeding out to die<br>

The bigger piece of cake, give my freedom back<br>

Condemning your soul would make me dry<br>

Waiting for you here, or to let it go<br>

Neither will I shout, nor will I ever cry<br>

Now if I tell you a story of old times,<br>

About that woman who tried and tried<br>

She looked every night at the changing sky<br>

Tears turned into wings and made her fly<br>

Madness grows in you, since you're just a child<br>

Do I need two wings? Do I need to fly?<br>

Decide what to feed your hungry mind<br>

Remember the way, I've already tried, I've already tried..
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I played the best way I could<br>

I poured my veins a treat of green<br>

If I wasn't trapped in here,<br>

How could everything have been
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I see your face here, on my room's wall<br>

Tell me that we'll fly, instead of fall<br>

If every light ends in darkness,<br>

What we'll we end in, if we start in the dark<br>

I feel your fingertips, on my burning corps<br>

Tell me there's no good, beyond this door<br>

I am imprisoned, in your Holly tower<br>

Want to stay in chains, and fly nowhere<br>

I know you'll someday, think of getting away<br>

It's never a good time for this childish wave<br>

I'll take a picture, to hang on my soul<br>

You can walk away, dig in me big holes<br>

Remember when they said, love is not for sale<br>

That I didn't deserve it, that their ship was sailed<br>

I don't wanna need, any stupid ship<br>

I want to adore, I want to worship, in my inside trip<br>

In this sickest trip…
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Hence, I grab your tiny heart,<br>

To make it mine,<br>

I'll break it with a million swats<br>

Heart burns and the light,<br>

Makes shadows disappear<br>

Heart burns and your tiny hope,<br>

Turns into despair, right.<br>

Hence I touch your tiny world<br>

To make it mine,<br>

I'll make it explode<br>

Words can ruin territories<br>

Love can rebuild what is ruined<br>

Take this pain as meditation<br>

Belief is the fruit of hesitation
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            On a far going wave in the ocean,<br>

Quietly sail your remained magic<br>

All curtains are opened and I see widely<br>

How our true despair, could be tragic
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Call me!<br>

Never get that frustrated by falling<br>

Falling calls me and falling calls,<br>

Non-reacting action toward these falls<br>

Call me and all subdued, I'll fall<br>

Fall and won't react against your towering wall<br>

Hearing this voice, all other sounds are dull<br>

Call me and I'll fall for fall.<br>

Let me wear that crown of non-queen roles,<br>

Where I'm nothing but a slave of yours<br>

Call me and I'll fall for my panic of braveness<br>

Call me and I'll draw scratches of blood, on this emptiness<br>

Call me and I'll fall for fall<br>

Call for my dreams to become that rootless doll,<br>

That when I was a sad child, I used to love<br>

Call me and I'll love to fall…
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Try to forget me with eyes wide awake<br>

In depth of the ocean with nowhere to escape<br>

Try to forget the blue veins on my skin<br>

The tears I have shed down to my chin<br>

Cold embraces which used to soothe you<br>

Cold embraces which turned my veins blue<br>

Try to forget the warmth you did not share<br>

For what breaks me, for the distance that I bare<br>

The unsteadiness that caused me to fall<br>

The shine in my eyes that seems so small<br>

The bird that dies trapped in solitude<br>

The utter existence of us so subdued<br>

Try to forgo the scent in your lungs<br>

For holding on to tomorrow that comes<br>

Try to remember, for I did protect<br>

Tyr to remember I let you forget.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Take me to the world that,<br>

The nauseating smell of regret is gone<br>

We'll dance to the point where,<br>

The cold show of this emptiness is done<br>

Take me to the right shoulder of the sky,<br>

Where the blossom of reality sprouts<br>

Take me to the free universe of ours<br>

O I'm so sick of this spineless, trembling house<br>

No fear of pain, no fear of abnormality of ours<br>

Take me to the depth of this shining coma<br>

No feelings of guilt in this sinful act of freedom<br>

I'll wait for the last blood drops in this trauma<br>

When the first flame of darkness lights me up,<br>

O lovely childhood, I'll be free of you.<br>

O little guilts, little impudent eyes of innocence,<br>

My sweet juveniles are on their way to murder you.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Devil wants to save me oh god!<br>

Why are your heavens hung in the dark?<br>

Tell me, where is the shine of the stars?<br>

Oh dear god!<br>

Give my Monster a reward.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The light, it slipped through the window<br>

The morning ripped you away oh<br>

Don’t wake me up<br>

Death is misleading<br>

And when I fall asleep,<br>

I sleep with a ghost<br>

I moved in the dark<br>

The room calm and cold<br>

The quiet hollow<br>

I am such a hunted soul<br>

Your ghost is gone<br>

The bed is so cold.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Something about you will always remain in me<br>

Something more than revolution<br>

Heart explosions for no-matter what!,<br>

Something beyond rebellious waves of the ocean<br>

Something about you will always remain in me<br>

As the wild horses neigh in far-away lands<br>

Something that flames candles in the dark,<br>

Like another fortune-reaching rope in my hands!<br>

Something about you will make me smile<br>

Tell me if my glow, has made you wake up<br>

Or if this is you, stealing my night sleeps,<br>

As you walk smoothly, under blood-drops<br>

Something about you will make me cry<br>

As tender as I am to embrace love<br>

Has this made you run into hesitation?<br>

Or it's your nature to be always tough…<br>

There's something about you,<br>

I'll always keep inside.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            When tension accelerates my breathing,<br>

Fire burns my eyes,<br>

And I feel warm,<br>

You are always there;<br>

To burn me in the corps I’m wearing on my lost soul.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Scrolls of devotional acts of love<br>

No respond to my written fights of mind<br>

Non-revolutionary, ordinary, daily life<br>

I'll embrace every shadow and every bit of light<br>

No fear in me when I check my empty mailbox<br>

No tension when I finally climb<br>

all the mountain rocks,<br>

With no rewards…<br>

Will you finally blossom for the truth I have in eyes<br>

or may I ask, does this matter at all...<br>

There's a limit to every fucking beauty<br>

As the vanishing-point constantly comes by<br>

No I look for no glowing tomorrow to come<br>

As I share my flesh with the soft moonlight<br>

I will not expect that cuddling warm you meant<br>

This wilderness I've landed in, is beautifully tough<br>

Now if I tell you tomorrow wouldn't come by,<br>

Will you spend with me this one single night?<br>

If I blow away all the dust from your sparkling eyes,<br>

Will that rough doubt, fly out of your mind?
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Remember I had love in your bed<br>

Where I got trapped in your private net<br>

I had some love in the window's crack<br>

Where destiny brought the sunshine back<br>

Look at this tree, glowing in glee<br>

The way we grew a full destiny<br>

Down on the roots, filthy weeds have grown<br>

The soul of the woods trapped in sorrow<br>

The lake is saturated by someone's blood<br>

Cold embraces that used to be hot<br>

The soul of the tree, Demon's holly dream<br>

Fake black angels cannot set us free<br>

Let your feet welter in the flowing blood<br>

Grab all you can in this heavy flood<br>

You know as I know, blue sky is far<br>

The tree's sounds of pain, set me free tonight!
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Get down on your knees, act modest and say your prayers,<br>

Behind the reeds, who reach to their highest<br>

Breathe with the rhyme of the water stream<br>

And scream your pain in another luminous dream<br>

Suck the poison out of my blue vein, please...<br>

As I'm constantly stuck within this chain of squeeze<br>

Say your prayers and let out the last cold sigh<br>

All the black dandelions under your feet, will cry<br>

Remain a little part of Eden as you fly<br>

Our sinful carcasses will stay down here, and dry.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Meet me darling in my solitude<br>

When the slumber meets your soul<br>

And through the perfect moments we had<br>

I'll take your hand and meet my dole<br>

This crack on the wall is sheding tears<br>

For the pictures stuck in old frames<br>

Nothing really changes if you escape, if I run away<br>

If you choose to wash my finger trace,<br>

off your shining face<br>

But we will both forget one day,<br>

And we will never be able to feel again<br>

I'll be cold in nights<br>

You'll be wasting your days<br>

Nostalgic places,<br>

The red bridge we didn't cross in some town,<br>

Light drops of autumn rain,<br>

We'll forget to feel,<br>

I'll forget to live agai
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I'm happy weather you believe it or not<br>

My soul shouts your name in my fragile heart<br>

If the world collapses and the skies get dark<br>

I'll chose to sleep with you once more, before I die<br>

Tell me to love you, to cry and then, fly<br>

Tell me to be subdued and my anger will calm<br>

If another life is given to me by the generous God<br>

I'll exchange it to feel again your fingers' touch<br>

It's crazy but even when you don't want me I fall,<br>

for the look in your eyes and the reason in your mind<br>

If you ask me about what I want in life,<br>

I'll break and tell you "I want to Want"!
